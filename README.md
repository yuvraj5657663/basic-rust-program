## Steps to start training

   At our company, we prioritize the growth and development of our interns by providing them with a structured self-learning process. To facilitate this, we have implemented an internal workflow designed to guide interns through their learning journey. We have created comprehensive documentation tailored to each role, which can be found in our [training](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training) repository's [discussions](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training/discussions). This documentation serves as a roadmap for interns, outlining the necessary skills and knowledge they need to acquire.

   To put their learning into practice, interns are encouraged to create their own issues in our [training](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training) repository. These issues act as assignments or projects that interns can work on to apply and reinforce their newly acquired skills. This hands-on approach allows interns to gain practical experience and build a solid foundation in their respective roles. We believe that this tailored learning workflow empowers interns to actively engage in their professional growth and development.

   2. After completing Git and Github leanring, Go to [VS Code](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training/discussions/categories/vs-code). Follow the same process of creating issue from discussion as per numbering and then go to training repo for created issue and complete it.
   3. After completing VSCode,  Go to [Rust Learning](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training/discussions/categories/rust) and follow the numbering system and create issue one by one.

### For Experience (Designer)

   1. Go to [Intro to Github](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training/discussions/3) discussion. Add comment `/create-issue`.
