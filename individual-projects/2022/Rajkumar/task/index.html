            <h1>The 5 Pages Every Website Needs</h1>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Your website is an important part of your business. Without it, you can lose potential customers and miss out on revenue.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you sell jewelry or counseling services, your site must tell a compelling story of who you are, how you can help visitors, what you offer, and how people can contact you. This virtual welcome gives people peace of mind.</p>
            
            <p>At a minimum, you’ll want to include five specific pages on your website to do this. </p>
            
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMeHwKofEm0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h2>5 Pages Every Website Needs</h2>
            <p>Do you have them all? Read below.</p>
            
            <section>
                <h2>1. Homepage</h2>
                
                <p>The homepage is where all the action happens on your site. It’s the first thing visitors see, and it determines if an individual will browse around or say goodbye.</p>
                
                <p>When crafting your homepage, you must think from the customer’s perspective. From navigation bars to images to copy, you control your visitors’ first impression.</p>
                
                <p>Visitors should clearly understand the objective of your homepage in just a few seconds. You want them to see your logo with a visible call-to-action button.</p>
                
                <p><a href="#">CarMax</a> implements this strategy flawlessly with simple copy and a self-explanatory header photo. Both new visitors and returning customers get user-friendly directions.</p>
                
                <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/wide-angle-shot-single-tree-growing-clouded-sky-during-sunset-surrounded-by-grass_181624-22807.jpg" alt="carmax_image">
                
                <p>Avoid cluttering your homepage with multiple, irrelevant images. You also don’t want outrageous color patterns. Represent your small business well by aiming for simplicity in your <a href="#">design.</a></p>
                
                <p>If you’re creating a new site or rebuilding an old one, get feedback from your potential visitors. Running a small soft launch will give you incredible insight to enhance your homepage.</p>
                
                <p>Your homepage should improve how visitors perceive your small business. It’s your gateway to raising brand awareness and gaining more conversions.</p>

                <h2>2. About Page</h2>
                <p>The <a href="#">About page</a> is an opportunity to elaborate on your brand’s vision and accomplishments. Be bold in your statements and discuss how your goals will help customers.</p>
                
                <p>Storytelling is pivotal for this page. You want readers to relate to your brand values, join your journey, and share the message with their family members and friends.</p>
                
                <p><q>An About us page is meant to connect emotionally with people. Hence, when you own a story that tells how you have touched lives, say it loud to the world. Such content humanizes your business supplying meaning and context for your product,</q> says <a href="#">Prince Kapoor</a>, a digital marketing analyst at LoginRadius.</p>
                
                <p><a href="#">Rent the Runway</a> uses its About page to share the company’s vision and mission. It discusses why the co-founders started the brand and gives an explanation for their relentless confidence. Then, it concludes with an open-ended question for the reader.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/wide-angle-shot-single-tree-growing-clouded-sky-during-sunset-surrounded-by-grass_181624-22807.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
                    <figcaption>our vision</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Consider adapting your About page to fit your audience’s needs. You may want to write it in multiple languages or make it easy to read with a timeline graph</p>
             </section>
             <section>
                <h2>3. Products or Services Page</h2>
                <p>The products and services page is the crux of most websites. It should convert a casual visitor into a frequent shopper. Rightfully so, you want to spend a considerable amount of time improving this page for the customer experience.</p>
                
                <p>When crafting a product description, you’ll want to sell the benefits, not the features. Tell a vivid story that emphasizes how buyers will feel after purchasing your product. You want them to feel a part of the product before they even receive it.</p>
                
                <p>Product photography plays an integral role, too. Highlight multiple angles of the product and allow users to zoom in and out. When applicable, shoot a short video to strengthen the visual experience.</p>
                
                <p><a href="#">Bobbi Brown Cosmetics’</a>product page offers a sleek, modern design. You don’t have to squint your eyes to see the product items. Shoppers also can visibly see the product’s star rating and price.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/wide-angle-shot-single-tree-growing-clouded-sky-during-sunset-surrounded-by-grass_181624-22807.jpg" alt="bobbi_BORROW">
                </figure>
                <article>If you <a href="#">sell services</a>, write the same elaborate descriptions. Give your customers context into how you deliver your services. For example, a hairdresser may spotlight the in-store experience of a serene ambience with immediate service.</article>
             </section>
             <section>
                <h2>4. Blog Page</h2>
                <p>The blog represents a major platform for your brand to talk directly with customers. You can feature product updates, the latest trends, and respond to buyers’ FAQs.</p>
                
                <p>Successful blogs are ongoing journeys, not destinations. Your blog must capture visitors’ attention and take them on your unique brand adventure. For instance, you may give them a behind-the-scenes look at product design or record a testimonial video with a happy customer.</p>
                
                <p>“Your blog posts can demonstrate your expertise in a particular subject area by sharing high-quality and relevant information with your readers. Over time, you can become known as a go-to resource that provides consistent and useful information,” writes <a href="#">Alyssa Gregory</a>, an entrepreneur, writer, and marketer.</p>
                
                <p>The Slack blog coincides with the brand’s mission to be a collaboration hub. You can read articles about product tips, work culture, and productivity. It’s a true reflection of teamwork.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/wide-angle-shot-single-tree-growing-clouded-sky-during-sunset-surrounded-by-grass_181624-22807.jpg">

                </figure>
                <p>In your blog, stay away from using your every post to sell products. Customers will quickly get annoyed and visit your competitor’s site. Instead, offer your visitors solutions and inspire them to live better.</p>
             </section>
             <section>
                <h2>5. Contact Page</h2>
                <p>Communication helps build solid relationships with your customers. You get to learn about their needs and desires as it relates to your products. Plus, it opens the door to receiving critical feedback.</p>
                
                <p>Think of your contact page as a customer support tool. The priority is to deliver a superb service, no matter the visitor’s reason. You want customers to get accurate information as well.</p>
                
                <p>Depending on your type of business, you may post the brand’s physical address, email address, or phone number. If you have a live chat option, please express the availability of the support agents on the page.</p>
                
                <p>When customers land on <a href="#">Burger King’s</a> contact page, they see an option to receive free food for completing a survey. They also can leave a message or call the fast food chain’s headquarters.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/wide-angle-shot-single-tree-growing-clouded-sky-during-sunset-surrounded-by-grass_181624-22807.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Contact us</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Your contact page should be easily accessible. You don’t want customers clicking through five different pages to connect with your business.</p>
                
                <p>The contact page is the perfect spot to set customer expectations. Let your visitors know your response time and commit to that promise.</p>
