Hi there! 👋

✅ **To begin** 

1. Simply write `create-issue` in the comment section below and press comment.

👉 **Once you do that**

1. The bot will create a new issue in this [training](https://github.com/StaytunedLLP/training) repository and assign it to you within 60-120 seconds.
2. If you do not receive a notification of the newly created issue within 5 minutes after creating a comment with the command `create-issue`, please try again later.
3. We recommend using GitHub Projects [My Training](https://github.com/orgs/StaytunedLLP/projects/31) to track and improve your training so you can grow faster.

We're excited to see what you can learn!
Good luck! 😀🙏
